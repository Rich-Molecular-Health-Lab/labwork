# Labwork Repository

Welcome to the **Labwork Repository**, the central hub for all wet lab methods, protocols, notebooks, and resources used by our lab. This repository serves as a reference for our laboratory operations, ensuring consistency and accessibility across our team.

## About This Repository

This repository is an **in-progress migration** as we transition from our Notion setup. During this period, content is being reorganized, updated, and refined. Expect periodic updates and adjustments as we work to improve the structure and completeness of this repository.

### What You'll Find Here

- **Wet Lab Methods**: Detailed step-by-step methods for various lab procedures.
- **Protocols**: Standard operating protocols (SOPs) for recurring experiments and workflows.
- **Notebooks**: Lab notebooks documenting experiments, observations, and results.
- **Templates**: Reusable templates for reporting and data recording.

### Computational and Bioinformatics Work

For anything related to computational analyses, bioinformatics pipelines, or statistical workflows, please refer to our **[Bioinformatics and Stats Repository](https://github.com/Rich-Molecular-Health-Lab/bioinformatics_stats)**. This repository is dedicated to all computational aspects of our lab work and complements the wet lab efforts documented here.
