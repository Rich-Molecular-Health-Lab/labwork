# Shiny Workflow for Library Prep

This repository contains our lab's working protocols for Library Prep. After pulling the complete repository, you can run the shiny app, which will prompt 
you to select one of the specific workflows and load one of our samplesets.

## Before you start a Library Prep Workflow

You should make sure your local copy of the repository contains the most up-to-date records for the sampleset you plan to work with. 
You can visit the bioinformatics/stats repo to check or to use the SampleInventory script to clean and update those files. They will automatically load in the 
working directory where this workflow expects to find them.
